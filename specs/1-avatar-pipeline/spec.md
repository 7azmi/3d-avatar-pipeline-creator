# Feature Specification: Automated Avatar Pipeline

**Feature Branch**: `1-avatar-pipeline`
**Created**: 2025-10-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build an automated, scalable pipeline that takes user-provided photos or video as input and produces a fully-rigged, lightweight 3D avatar optimized for real-time web browser-based conversation."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Single Photo → Conversation-Ready Avatar (Priority: P1)
A user uploads one or more still photos (front/three-quarter) and receives a packaged, fully-rigged
3D avatar optimized to run in a web browser for conversational use.

**Why this priority**: This is the smallest viable input path that delivers the core value —
users can produce a conversation-ready avatar from common inputs.

**Independent Test**: Upload a representative photo via the CLI or test harness; pipeline runs
end-to-end and produces a packaged runtime artifact that can be loaded in a headless browser
and exercise the conversation API.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user uploads at least one clear face photo, **When** the pipeline completes, **Then**
   the spec artifacts include: a glTF-based runtime package with a rig, viseme map, and a
   documented runtime API; loading the package in the demo page yields an avatar that accepts
   a text speech event and drives visemes and basic expressions.
2. **Given** the input photo is low-quality but valid, **When** the pipeline runs, **Then** the
   system produces an artifact plus a refinement recommendation (e.g., "additional angles
   recommended") so the user can opt-in to higher-quality refinement.

---

### User Story 2 - Video / Multi-Frame Input (Priority: P2)
A user provides a short video or multiple frames to improve geometry, texture fidelity, and
expression capture. The pipeline uses temporal cues to improve face reconstruction and lip-sync
alignment.

**Why this priority**: Video input enables higher-quality results but increases processing cost
and complexity; keep as P2 for MVP.

**Independent Test**: Run pipeline with a short (5–15s) video and verify improved mesh fidelity
and more accurate viseme timing compared to single-photo baseline.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** short video input, **When** the pipeline completes, **Then** the packaged artifact
   contains higher-fidelity textures/mesh and metadata indicating which frames contributed to
   high-confidence regions.

---

### Edge Cases

- Input missing a clear frontal face: pipeline should fail fast with an explainable error and
  recommended steps (e.g., request additional angles).
- Occlusions (glasses, hair): pipeline documents diminished confidence per-region and emits a
  refinement suggestion.
- Multiple faces in input: pipeline rejects or asks user to select the target subject.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST accept user-submitted photos and short videos (file upload or
  CLI path) and validate inputs for face presence and minimal quality.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST produce a packaged runtime artifact containing:
  - a web-optimized 3D model (glTF 2.0 preferred),
  - a rig with named joints and blendshape/morph targets (where applicable),
  - viseme mappings and lip-sync timing metadata,
  - a minimal runtime API surface for conversational events (onUtteranceStart, onViseme,
    onExpression), and
  - artifact metadata including input hashes and transformation provenance.
- **FR-003**: The runtime artifact MUST be loadable in a modern browser demo page and expose
  the documented conversation API.
- **FR-004**: The pipeline MUST be automatable via CLI and CI (scripted entrypoint) and accept
  configuration for deterministic runs (input hashes, fixed seeds where non-determinism exists).
- **FR-005**: The system MUST version artifacts and store refinement records so that further
  refinement steps are reproducible.
- **FR-006**: When inputs violate the "Lightweight Web-First" or "No Recurring/Streaming Costs"
  constraints, the pipeline MUST reject the plan or return a documented, time-limited exception
  with a migration plan.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001**: The pipeline SHOULD produce artifacts that meet the project's performance budget
  (see Assumptions); plans that expect larger assets MUST include explicit trade-offs and
  migration steps.
- **NFR-002**: Pipeline build-time tasks may use cloud compute (CI), but runtime MUST NOT require
  per-user GPU services.
- **NFR-003**: The pipeline SHOULD emit measurable quality/confidence scores for mesh, texture,
  and viseme alignment.

## Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **AvatarPackage**: The output archive containing the runtime model, rig, textures, viseme map,
  metadata, and a small manifest.
- **Rig**: Named joints and blendshape targets required by the runtime.
- **VisemeMap**: Mapping from phoneme or time-based cues to animation targets.
- **RefinementRecord**: Versioned record describing inputs, transformations, and operator notes.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: End-to-end pipeline (single-photo input) completes and produces a conversation-ready
  runtime package in <= 30 seconds on a standard CI build agent (document the agent spec in plan).
- **SC-002**: The produced runtime package (compressed, transmission-ready) is <= 15 MB for the
  default quality tier and loads and is interactive in a modern browser within 3 seconds on a
  typical consumer connection.
- **SC-003**: The demo page invoking the runtime API can drive viseme/expressions and the avatar
  responds to conversational events with perceptually acceptable lip-sync in at least 80% of
  short utterances (evaluation via test harness or human eval).
- **SC-004**: Artifact provenance is recorded and the same deterministic inputs + pipeline
  configuration reproduce identical artifact hashes.

## Assumptions

- The project follows the constitution: web-first runtimes, no per-user GPU streaming at runtime,
  and automation-first pipelines.
- Acceptable default performance/size budgets for MVP are: <=15 MB compressed artifact, browser
  load <3s. These may be adjusted and must be documented in each plan.
- CI/build agents for initial validation are allowed to use cloud GPUs for offline preprocessing
  (build-time only).

## Acceptance Tests (high level)

- Run pipeline on canonical test photo(s); load result in headless browser; call text->speech event
  and assert viseme events emitted and avatar reacts without console errors.
- Run with low-quality inputs and assert pipeline returns user-facing guidance and a refinement
  record.

## Notes

- Implementation details (frameworks, specific ML models) are intentionally omitted: they belong
  in the implementation plan.
